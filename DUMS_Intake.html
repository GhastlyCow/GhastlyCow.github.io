                The Powertrain team at Duke Motorsports decided to transition
                from a Turbo Yamaha CP2 platform to a NA Yamaha CP2 Platform.
                Due to this change, I was tasked with designing a brand new
                rules legal and optimized restrictor and intake manifold. The
                team settled on a few constraints that I had to follow:
              </p>

                  <li style="padding-left: 5px">
                    To remain rules legal (FSAE Rule IC.1.2) and also to give
                    Aerodynamics a rear wing bounding box, the intake must lie
                    in the Tire Surface Envelope.
                  </li>
                  <li style="padding-left: 5px">
                    The designed intake must be easily manufacturable in-house.
                    It was decided that Intake Manifold parts must be able to be
                    3D printed on a Bambu labs P1P.

                  <li style="padding-left: 5px">
                    The Intake Manifold Prototypes must have easily
                    interchangeable runner lengths and plenum volume to allow
                    for effective dyno testing.

              <h3>Restrictor Design</h3>
            </div>
            <div class="col-sm-12 col-sm-12 text-left">
              <p>
                I decided to first tackle the design of the restrictor nozzle
                for the manifold. In FSAE, all cars are required to have a
                restrictor with a maximum diameter of 20mm if gas-fueled and
                19mm if e85-fueled (FSAE Rule IC.2.4.3). <br />
                After reading a few research papers on the differences between
                restrictor-nozzles, I settled on optimizing a venturi-nozzle
                restrictor. I did this by running CFD simulations on
                venturi-nozzle restrictors with varying converging and diverging
                angles, 10-18 degrees and 6-14 degrees respectively. The goal
                was to find the restrictor that optimized both pressure drop and
                overall length.

                The boundary conditions for this restrictor sim was as follows:
                <br />
                Inlet: 101365 Pa (1 atm) Outlet: 0.074 kg/s (This number was
                found by first using the NASA choked flow equation to yield
                0.0703 kg/s but did not yield choked flow in simulation, so from
                there I used that as a baseline and ran CFD simulations until I
                was able to get an "experimental" value that yielded choke in
                the restrictor.)

              I ran ANSYS Fluent CFD simulations on every combination of
              converging-diverging in the range as described above. After
              running the simulations. I found that the restrictor with a
              converging angle of 16 and diverging angle of 6 had the least
              pressure drop but it was too long, but the restrictor with a
              converging angle of 16 and diverging angle of 8 yielded similar
              performance at a much shorter overall length. <br />
              <br />
              The next steps with restrictor design will be using the wind
              tunnel available on campus to experiementally verify the pressure
              drop and choking mass flow rate.

                Next, I moved on to designing the plenum and runners. To find
                the ideal length of the runners, I both referenced the math from
                our previous intakes which used hemholtz reasonance, and my own,
                which used acoustic resonance. After some spreadsheet math, I
                determined that the ideal runner length (3RD wave tuned) is
                between 10.2 to 10.35 in. From there, I weighed the 3 different
                ways to "grab" air from the plenum and move it to the runners.

                I utilized ANSYS Discovery to optimize all 3 types of
                plenum+runner designs (Image of CFD simulation below). I found
                that an optimized intake with velocity stacks outperformed the
                simple design significantly and the tapered one only slightly.
                Since the velocity stack intake manifold design is still
                feasible to manufacture using 3D printing, I decided to move
                forward with that design.

                All of my full intake manifold CFD simulations were optimized
                using a steady-state approach. However, this approach does not
                fully recreate the actual behavior of the intake manifold. It
                allowed me to find deadzones and pockets in my plenum designs,
                but I am currently working on a transient model to simulate the
                airflow in the intake with the spinning of the crankshaft. I
                have also split my model into 3 3D printer-friendly parts
                (restrictor, plenum, runners). I will be 3D printing these to
                begin initial dyno experiemental verifications of my simulation
                data.

                This page encompasses most of the restrictor and intake manifold
                summer design I have been able to accomplish for Duke
                Motorsports. Coming into this project, I had zero experience
                with ANSYS and CFD and even how to go about designing an Intake
                Manifold. Thanks to the mentorship of my team leads and the many
                research papers available online, my knoweldge on CFD, Intake
                Manifolds, and overall Powertrain Design skyrocketed over the
                last couple months. As I go back to college, I am excited to
                continue the design process and finally get to see the physical
                model of something I have been designing and simulating all
